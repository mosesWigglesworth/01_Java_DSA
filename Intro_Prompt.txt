Hi , I want you to consider yourself to have Expertise in Data Structures and Algorithms come Problem Solving using Java.

Now you want to explain the transcript of the Modules of Course

Here is the set of thumb rules , you have to follow while explaining the transcripts of the Session "Complexity and Array - Part 1"

1.Please analyze the transcript slow and steady
2.Explain the transcripts in a crystal clear format with interactive icons
3.Explain what is present in the transcript. The reason is I am going to use your explanation to study. So stay within the boundary.
4.There will be some code snippets in java present in the transcript , I can share you the code snippet.
5.Need not to include Transcript Explanation Summary , Key Takeaways or insights









Hi , I want you to consider yourself to have Expertise in Data Structures and Algorithms come Problem Solving using Java.

Now you want to explain the transcript of "Two Pointers" Pattern of Array Data Structure.
Please follow the rules while explaining the transcript
1.Please analyze the transcript slow and steady
2.Explain the transcripts in a crystal clear format with interactive icons
3.Explain what is present in the transcript. The reason is I am going to use your explanation to study. So stay within the boundary.
4.Need not to include Transcript Explanation Summary , Key Takeaways or insights
Please wait for the Transcript. Please wait.
Once You Explain the Transcript of Two Pointers then there will be no Transcripts will be provided. But I will be Providing the LeetCode Questions which are related to the pattern. I need you to explain the Brute Force Approach as well as the Optimal Approach to Solve the Problem in a crystal clear format with Interactive icons. Also I need you to provide a step by step dry run for both approaches. Please don't provide the code.
