Great, this is a **~46-week window** (Jan 19–Nov 30, 2026, assuming weeks start Monday).
Below is a **realistic, week-by-week study plan** that steadily moves from basics → advanced DSA → revision, and **finishes by Nov 30, 2026**, leaving Dec 1 as buffer.

I’ve structured it so:

* **Weeks 1–12**: Strong programming foundations
* **Weeks 13–24**: Core DSA
* **Weeks 25–36**: Advanced DSA & Algorithms
* **Weeks 37–44**: Dynamic Programming + Mixed Practice
* **Weeks 45–46**: Revision + Mock interviews
